# Shopify Front-End Challenge
For the Shopify Front-End Challenge, I have built and deployed the web application at: https://aarya-patel.github.io/ShopifyFront-End/. As for the technical features, I have included: 
* Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
* Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
* Updates to the search terms should update the result list
* Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
* If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
* Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.

For the extra features, I have included the ability to store nomination even after exiting the application. I used local storage in the browser to help me acheive implement this feature.
